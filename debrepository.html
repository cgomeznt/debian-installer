<h4 style="color: red;">WARNING</h4>
<p>I now consider this HOWTO deprecated.  At the time that I wrote it, 
the available tools were seriously lacking.  Nowadays, the tools are 
much better and much easier to setup.  I encourage you to use the setup 
described in Debian Administration's <a href="http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/286"><i>Setting up your own APT repository with upload support</i></a>
 article.  I now use a setup that is nearly identical to the one 
described in the article.  However, I will leave this HOWTO here 
indefinitely as it may be of interest to some.</p>

<h3><a id="intro">Introduction</a></h3>

<p>This HOWTO was inspired by several things:</p>
<ul>
<li>A desire to more effectively manage some packages I have backported and created locally (kernel images and JDK packages).</li>
<li>A desire to help others who are interested in creating a local repository.</li>
<li>A desire to help extend some of the available documentation, which does not go into sufficient detail.</li>
<li>An interest in creating an automatic repository (which is not so 
well documented), as opposed to a trivial repository (which limits 
flexibility).</li>
</ul>

<p>There are also many good reasons as to why you may want to create 
your own package repository.  Say you are trying to install something 
that depends on the package <code>j2sdk1.4</code>.  This is not possible
 without outside sources, since Debian does not distribute JREs or JDKs.
  Naturally, you could just add the Blackdown deb sources to your 
sources.list and be on your way.  But what if you prefer the Sun JRE?  
You would have to download it from Sun and manually install it.  If you 
do this with enough packages you will lose track or begin forgetting 
where you have placed things.</p>

<p>In my case, I used the excellent package <a href="http://packages.debian.org/java-package">java-package</a>
 to create a .deb file from the Sun JRE .bin file.  Now I can place that
 .deb file into my repository, and it only gets installed if I have 
packages that depend on it.  If I remove all of the depending packages, 
the JRE is also removed.  I can <code>apt-get install</code> the JRE 
onto all of my machines without need for a manual installation each 
time.  If an update is released, I can create the requisite .deb package
 and place it in my repository so that all of my machines update 
automatically.</p>

<p>Additionally, what if you want to customize an existing Debian 
package and have it available to all your Debian machines?  I also have a
 detailed walkthrough on <a href="http://people.connexer.com/%7Eroberto/howtos/debcustomize">customizing Debian packages</a>.
  Once you have customized more than a couple of packages, it will be 
much easier to keep track of them if they are all in a local repository 
accessible by APT.  Clearly, there are many reasons why you may want to 
create your own repository.</p>

<p>An additional motivation for me to write this was because some people out there <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-user/2005/01/msg00055.html">are unhappy</a>
 with all of the trivial repositories floating around out there.  
Apparently, trivial repositories are not compatible with apt-pinning and
 make life difficult for those people who make use of unofficial package
 repositories and like to pin their packages.</p>

<p>The main source of information during my discovery process was Aaron Isotton's <a href="http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/repository-howto/repository-howto.en.html">Debian Repository HOWTO</a>.
  This document gives an excellent overview of the process, but is 
lacking in some areas.  Specifically, the finer details of generating 
all the files necessary to make your repository work.</p>

<p>This document assumes that you have a good level of understanding of 
the Debian distribution and feel comfortable using the command line.</p>

<h3><a id="alternatives">Alternatives</a></h3>

<p>It would not be fair of me to let you think that this is the only 
possible way to setup a Debian package repository.  Naturally, you could
 just install your packages locally using <code>dpkg -i</code>, or simply find packages in someone else's repository, like, for example, those listed at <a href="http://www.apt-get.org/">apt-get.org</a>.</p>

<p>Two possible alternatives are <a href="http://alioth.debian.org/projects/mirrorer/">mirrorer</a> and <a href="http://dak.ganneff.de/pool/main/d/dak/">dak</a>.
  The mirrorer software is currently only available via CVS, but 
provides support for more advanced repositories (i.e., a pooled 
structure without a database server and the ability to check and 
generate signatures).  The dak package is used directly in the 
maintenance of the official Debian repository and is now available 
officially in the <a href="http://packages.debian.org/dak">Debian archive</a>.</p>

<p>Another alternative is an automated tool by Ola Lundqvist called <a href="http://packages.debian.org/debarchiver">debarchiver</a>.  This tool will automatically create a repository for you in <code>/var/lib/debarchiver</code>.  It also creates an incoming directory where you place your packages along with a <code>.changes</code>
 file and sets up a cron job to monitor the directory and automatically 
migrate the packages for you.  This is more in line with how the real 
Debian repository operates.  I was not really aware of all the 
functionality of this tool when I embarked on my quest.</p>

<p>Since I change my repository infrequently, I have chosen to not use 
debarchiver.  Naturally, you can choose to make use of derbarchiver or 
to take my more manual approach.  If you still want to do it this way or
 if you just want to see better how a Debian package repository is 
structured, then read on.</p>

<h3><a id="start">Getting Started</a></h3>

<p>Necessary packages:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://packages.debian.org/apt-utils">apt-utils</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Other necessities:</p>
<ul>
<li>A place to store your packages (local directory, or remote FTP or web space).</li>
</ul>

<p>I have made the assumption that you will be creating your package 
repository locally and then using it locally or uploading it to a remote
 machine and accessing it from there.  If the machine you will be using 
to create the repository has an HTTP or FTP server running, you can 
access your packages locally and remotely from other machines.  If you 
have a remote server that you can access via SSH, or some other shell, 
then you can simply create everything on the remote machine and access 
it from anywhere you like.</p>

<h3><a id="setup">Setting Up</a></h3>

<p>You first need a directory structure to house your packages.  Here are some example choices for a root:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>~/packages/</code></li>
<li><code>/packages/</code></li>
<li><code>/var/www/debian/</code></li>
<li><code>/usr/local/packages/</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Your choice depends on whether you intend to serve your packages to 
remote machines or use them only on the local machine.  You should 
create the desired directory and <code>cd</code> into it.</p>

<p>Now you need to create the remainder of your directory tree.  You can visit the <a href="http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/repository-howto/repository-howto.en.html">Debian Repository HOWTO</a>
 for a detailed look at exactly how the real Debian repository is 
structured.  I have personally chosen to model mine after that 
structure, but your needs will dictate your choice.  Regardless, you 
need to start by creating a directory below your repository root called <code>dists/</code>.</p>

<p>In my case, I serve my repository to all the machines on my LAN via Apache, so my repository is located at <code>/var/www/debian/</code>, with the directory <code>dists/</code> one level below that.</p>

<p>Under <code>dists/</code>, you need to create one or more directories
 for the distributions you will serve packages to.  In my case, I have 
one server and two PCs running Sarge, so I have the directory <code>dists/sarge/</code>.</p>

<p>Now you need to make yet another choice.  What sections will you 
have?  The sections are those which follow your distribution line the 
sources.list.  For example, the Debian package source:</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px"><code>deb http://ftp.es.debian.org/debian/ sarge main non-free contrib</code></p>

<p>contains the distribution <code>sarge</code>, and the sections <code>main</code>, <code>contrib</code> and <code>non-free</code>.</p>

<p>To see an example of a repository with a slightly different structure, visit <a href="http://backports.org/">backports.org</a>.
  They have structured their sections so that they are named after 
individual packages.  That way you can make certain that you get only 
the backported packages you want.  Personally, I take the former 
approach, since it is my personal repository and I don't introduce any 
packages I don't want.</p>

<p>Below each section you will need one or more binary directories and 
an optional source directory.  In my case, all of my machines are i386 
architecture, so I have a <code>binary-i386/</code> and a <code>source/</code>, since I choose to also maintain source packages whenever possible.</p>

<p>When you are done creating all the directories, you should have a structure similar to this:</p>
<p class="codelisting">
<code>
$ find . -type d<br>
.<br>
/dists<br>
/dists/sarge<br>
/dists/sarge/contrib<br>
/dists/sarge/contrib/binary-i386<br>
/dists/sarge/contrib/source<br>
/dists/sarge/main<br>
/dists/sarge/main/binary-i386<br>
/dists/sarge/main/source<br>
/dists/sarge/non-free<br>
/dists/sarge/non-free/binary-i386<br>
/dists/sarge/non-free/source<br>
</code>
</p>

<h3><a id="populating">Populating the Repository</a></h3>

<p>Now you must place your package files in their corresponding 
directories.  How you do this is a matter of choice, though taking the 
time to organize yourself properly in the beginning pays off as your 
repository grows larger.  Typically, binary .debs (those which you can 
install directly with an <code>apt-get install</code> command, would go in their corresponding <code>binary-i386/</code> directory.  If you support a different processor architecture, then you would use that instead.</p>

<p>The only thing I have not managed to figure out yet is a pooled 
repository, like the Debian repository.  This is where every package is 
kept in a common directory and the respective <code>binary-$(ARCH)/</code>
 directories only contain a reference to the appropriate files.  This 
comes in handy when you have to support more than one architecture, 
since certain package (e.g., documentation, interpreted scripts, etc.) 
are the same and do not require architecture-dependent compilation.  
However, since I only have i386 machines, I have not bothered to learn 
how to do this.  Perhaps in the future.</p>

<p>Each <code>binary-i386/</code> directory and <code>source/</code> directory requires a file called <code>Release</code>, which indicates the target architecture and some additional information.  For example, the <code>Release</code> file for the for the Sarge main binary files is located at <code>/dists/sarge/main/binary-i386/Release</code> and has these contents:</p>

<p class="codelisting">
<code>
Archive: stable<br>
Component: main<br>
Origin: &lt;Your name or organization&gt;<br>
Label: &lt;A descriptive label&gt;<br>
Architecture: &lt;Your processor arch or "source"&gt;<br>
</code>
</p>

<p>Once you are finished creating the necessary files, you should have something like this:</p>
<p class="codelisting">
<code>
$ find . -name Release<br>
/dists/sarge/contrib/binary-i386/Release<br>
/dists/sarge/contrib/source/Release<br>
/dists/sarge/main/binary-i386/Release<br>
/dists/sarge/main/source/Release<br>
/dists/sarge/non-free/binary-i386/Release<br>
/dists/sarge/non-free/source/Release<br>
</code>
</p>

<p>Don't forget to update the archive, component and architecture fields for each file.</p>

<h3><a id="config">Preparing the Config Files</a></h3>

<p>I have two configuration files:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>apt-sarge-release.conf</code>: This file is used to generate the Sarge "Release" file</li>
<li><code>apt-ftparchive.conf</code>: This file is used to tell <code>apt-ftparchive</code> what distributions and sections need to be processed.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these files reside in the repository root.  The contents of 
each are listed below.  If you are really interested, you can read the <code>apt-ftparchive(1)</code> documentation.  It is a bit hard to follow, but still informative.</p>

<p>Contents of <code>apt-sarge-release.conf</code>:</p>
<p class="codelisting">
<code>
APT::FTPArchive::Release::Origin "Your name or organization";<br>
APT::FTPArchive::Release::Label "Descriptive label";<br>
APT::FTPArchive::Release::Suite "stable";<br>
APT::FTPArchive::Release::Codename "sarge";<br>
APT::FTPArchive::Release::Architectures "i386 source";<br>
APT::FTPArchive::Release::Components "main contrib non-free";<br>
APT::FTPArchive::Release::Description "More detailed description";<br>
</code>
</p>

<p>Below are the contents of the <code>apt-ftparchive.conf</code> file. 
 I know that there are more efficient ways to accomplish the same thing.
  However, I was unable to get them to work.  The documentation makes is
 seem as though it is possible to specify a generic directory structure 
and let apt-ftparchive find all the specific directories.  But nothing I
 could do would make it find a directory that I had not explicitly 
stated.  So, here is the brute force approach:</p>

<p class="codelisting">
<code>
Dir {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;ArchiveDir ".";<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;CacheDir ".";<br>
};<br>
<br>
Default {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Packages::Compress ". gzip bzip2";<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sources::Compress "gzip bzip2";<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Contents::Compress "gzip bzip2";<br>
};<br>
<br>
BinDirectory "dists/sarge/main/binary-i386" {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Packages "dists/sarge/main/binary-i386/Packages";<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Contents "dists/sarge/Contents-i386";<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;SrcPackages "dists/sarge/main/source/Sources";<br>
};<br>
<br>
BinDirectory "dists/sarge/contrib/binary-i386" {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Packages "dists/sarge/contrib/binary-i386/Packages";<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Contents "dists/sarge/Contents-i386";<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;SrcPackages "dists/sarge/contrib/source/Sources";<br>
};<br>
<br>
BinDirectory "dists/sarge/non-free/binary-i386" {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Packages "dists/sarge/non-free/binary-i386/Packages";<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Contents "dists/sarge/Contents-i386";<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;SrcPackages "dists/sarge/non-free/source/Sources";<br>
};<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
Tree "dists/sarge" {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sections "main contrib non-free";<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Architectures "i386 source";<br>
};<br>
<br>
Default {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Packages {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extensions ".deb";<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;};<br>
};<br>
</code>
</p>

<p>Once you have the configuration files tweaked to your liking, you are
 ready to actually make your repository "visible" to apt.  Personally, I
 found it easier and more efficient to create a short shell script to do
 this for me.  I called it <code>update-archive.sh</code> and put in the repository root along with the configuration files.  The contents are listed below:</p>

<p class="codelisting">
<code>
#!/bin/sh<br>
apt-ftparchive generate apt-ftparchive.conf<br>
apt-ftparchive -c apt-sarge-release.conf release dists/sarge/ &gt;dists/sarge/Release<br>
</code>
</p>

<h3><a id="updating">Updating the Repository</a></h3>

<p>Once all the files and packages are in place, you can proceed to 
update the repository databases.  You can do this by running the shell 
script listed above or manually executing the commands.  The output 
should resemble this:</p>

<p class="codelisting">
<code>
$ /update-archive.sh<br>
&nbsp;dists/sarge/main/binary-i386: 21 files 42.7MB 2s<br>
&nbsp;dists/sarge/contrib/binary-i386: 0 files 0B 0s<br>
&nbsp;dists/sarge/non-free/binary-i386: 4 files 114MB 5s<br>
&nbsp;dists/sarge/main/binary-i386/: 21 files 42.7MB 0s<br>
&nbsp;dists/sarge/contrib/binary-i386/: 0 files 0B 0s<br>
&nbsp;dists/sarge/non-free/binary-i386/: 4 files 114MB 0s<br>
&nbsp;dists/sarge/main/source/: 2 pkgs in 0s<br>
&nbsp;dists/sarge/contrib/source/: 0 pkgs in 0s<br>
&nbsp;dists/sarge/non-free/source/: 0 pkgs in 0s<br>
Done Packages, Starting contents.<br>
Done. 314MB in 50 archives. Took 7s<br>
</code>
</p>

<p>You will need to update your repository periodically.  You can either
 set a cron job to run your script, or run it manually whenever you add 
or remove packages.</p>

<h3><a id="using">Using the Repository</a></h3>

<p>You can either use the repository locally or remotely.</p>

<p>For local access:</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px"><code>deb file:///path/to/repository/ sarge main non-free contrib</code></p>

<p>For remote access (like an official apt repository):</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px"><code>deb http://your.server/repository/ sarge main non-free contrib</code></p>
